# Bolt's Journal

## 2025-02-18 - [Initial Setup]
**Learning:** Journal initialized.
**Action:** Record critical performance learnings here.

## 2025-02-18 - [Legacy Linting Issues]
**Learning:** The project has pre-existing linting errors in `App.jsx` and `tailwind.config.js` that prevent a clean `pnpm lint` run. `DiaryList.jsx` also had unused variables which I fixed/suppressed.
**Action:** When working on existing files, prioritize fixing local lint errors to maintain file hygiene, but acknowledge global lint failures are out of scope for a single task.
